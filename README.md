# Bank_Fraud_Predictive
Model to predict whether or not a bank application is fraudulent, coded in R.

I used a large, realistic dataset from Kaggle for this project.
Data available here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022

Base Analysis uses the Base dataset, which represents the real-world, anonymized fraud data.
Variant V Analysis uses the Variant V datset, which has better separability in the training data.
Both datasets contain 1,000,000 rows and 32 variables.

I created this project for the course Econ 695: Big Data Analytics in Spring 2023.
As part of the class, I gave a five minute presentation on my project and wrote up a findings report. Those files can also be found in this folder.
